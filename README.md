### Problems Faced

-   During the execution of Next auth I was constantly gettin error on "Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server." After closer inspection on the error message i found that it was this "<p> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>."
    [Josh W. Cameau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration/) has a great article on this.
